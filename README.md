# Single source area with Case-based reasoning method

This method includes similarity calculating part and landslide susceptibility modeling part.

The similarity calculating part is to obtain the study area with the highest similarity for the target area based on Similarity_functions.R. The landslide susceptibility modeling part is to train the model using data from the study area with the highest similarity for the target area based on Landslide_Susceptibility_Modeling.R.
